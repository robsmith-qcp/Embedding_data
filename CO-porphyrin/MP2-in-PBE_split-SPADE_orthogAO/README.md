This subdirectory includes input and output files that compute a the energy of the system for the projection-based embedding calculation of MP2 for the active space and DFT for the environment, using the PBE functional.
The orbital partitioning method is split-SPADE using an orthogonal projector.
The files are labeled CO, reactant(porphyrin), or product.
