This subdirectory includes input and output files that compute a the embedded energy of the system, and the molden files for the MOs of each subspace for each simulation. The files are labeled by the O-H distance in Angstroms, e.g. 3p0 denotes the chosen hydrogen on the water molecule is 3.0 Angstroms away from the oxygen on the ketone.
