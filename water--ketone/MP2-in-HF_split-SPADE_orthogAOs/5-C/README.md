This subdirectory includes input and output files that compute a the embedded energy of the system, and the molden files for the MOs of each subspace for each simulation. The files are labeled by the O-H distance in Angstroms, e.g. 3p0 denotes the chosen hydrogen on the water molecule is 3.0 Angstroms away from the oxygen on the ketone. The files denoted by no cutoff use all the singular values to rotate the occupied MOs into the active space during the partitioning, instead of using the largest gap of the singular value spectrum to inform on which right singular vectors are employed in the transformation.
