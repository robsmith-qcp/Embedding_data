These subdirectories are organized by the chosen active space of the system. The system of interest is a water molecule interacting with 6-undecanone. The active spaces are denoted by the number of carbons in said active space. 1-C describes the active space that is defined by the AOs associated with the water molecule, and the carbonyl group. 3-C describes the active space that includes the carbons that are nearest neighbor to the carbonyl, their associated hydrogens, and all the atoms described by the 1-C active space. This pattern is continued with 5-C containing the next-nearest neighbors, and so on. An active space of 11 carbons can be viewed as performing a "high-level" calculation on this entire system, therefore we truncate at 9 carbons.
