This subdirectory includes input and output files that compute a the energy of the system for the projection-based embedding calculation of MP2 for the active space and DFT for the environment, using the B3LYP functional.
The orbital partitioning method is SPADE using an oblique projector.
The files are labeled by the bond rotation angle.
