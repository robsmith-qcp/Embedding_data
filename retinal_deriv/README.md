The subdirectories herein are organized by the method used to compute the ground-state energies of the system. These subdirectories are labeled as either a "low-level" theory (HF or some DFT functional), "high-level" theory (some post-HF method), or as a projection based embedding method. The projection-based embedding methods are denoted as "high-level"-in-"low-level" followed by the partitioning scheme employed.
